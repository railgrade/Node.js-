# Elm Architecture

Now we've had a bit of a feel for what writing Crux apps is like, we'll add more context to the different components and the overall architecture of Crux apps. The architecture is heavily inspired by [Elm](http://elm-lang.org), and if you'd like to compare, the [Architecture page of their guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) is an excellent starting point.

## Event Sourcing as a model for UI

User Interface is fundamentally event-driven. Unlike batch or stream processing, all changes in apps with UI are driven by events happening in the outside world, most commonly the user interface itself â€“ the user touching the screen, typing on a keyboard, executing a CLI command, etc. In response, the app changes what's shown on the screen, starts an interaction with the outside world, or both.

The Elm architecture is the simplest way of modeling this pattern in code. User interactions (along with other changes in the outside world, such as time passing) are represented by events, and in response to them, the app updates its internal state represented by a model. The link between them is a simple, pure function which takes the model and the event, and updates the model based on the events. The actual UI on screen is a direct projection of the model. Because there is virtually no other state in the app, the model must contain enough information to decide what should be on screen.

What we're missing is for the app to be able to respond to e
